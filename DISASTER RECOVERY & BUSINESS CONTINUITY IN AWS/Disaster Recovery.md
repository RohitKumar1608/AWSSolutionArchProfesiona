****DR/BC Architecture****

  -  Effective DR/BC costs money all of the time
  -  We need some type of extra resources which will increase costs
  -  Executing disaster recover/business continuity process takes time. How long it takes depends on the type of DR/BC in usage
  -  DR/BC is trade-off between the time and costs

******Types of Disaster Recovery******

****Backup and Restore:****
  - Data is constantly backup up at the primary site
  - The only costs are backup media and management, no ongoing space infrastructure costs
  - Has little or no upfront costs, but implies a significant time for recovery
****Pilot Light::****
  - Primary site is running at full
  - Pilot Light implies running a secondary environment only having the absolute minimum services running
  - In the event of a disaster the shutdown services can be spined up, no costs are expected to be inquired if there is no need for DR
****Warm Standby:****
  - Primary site is running at full, everything is replicated on the backup site at a smaller scale
  - Ready to be increased in size when failover is required
  - It is faster than pilot light approach and cheaper than active/active approach
****Active/Active (Multi-site):****
  - Primary site is entirely replicated on a secondary site
  - Data is constantly replicated from the primary site to the backup
  - Costs are generally 200%
  - There is no concept of recovery time
 **Additional benefits:**
    - Load balancing across environments
    - Improved HA and performance
****Summary:****
  - Backups: cheap and slow
  - Pilot Light: fairly cheap but faster
  - Warm Standby: costly, but quick to recover
  - Active/Active: expensive, 0 recovery time
