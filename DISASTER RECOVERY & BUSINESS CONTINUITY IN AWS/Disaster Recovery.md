****DR/BC Architecture****

  -  Effective DR/BC costs money all of the time
  -  We need some type of extra resources which will increase costs
  -  Executing disaster recover/business continuity process takes time. How long it takes depends on the type of DR/BC in usage
  -  DR/BC is trade-off between the time and costs
