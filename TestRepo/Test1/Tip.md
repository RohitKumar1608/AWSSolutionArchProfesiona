1.   **AWS Snowball ** is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers, including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns.

AWS Snowball moves terabytes of data in about a week. You can use it to move things like databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, IoT sensor data,      and media content, especially when network conditions prevent realistic timelines for transferring large amounts of data both into and out of AWS. Data from the Snowball device     will be imported to your selected Amazon S3 bucket.

2. **AWS VM Import/Export** enables you to easily import virtual machine images from your existing environment to Amazon EC2 instances and export them back to your on-premises environment. VM Import/Export is available at no additional charge beyond standard usage charges for Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. As part of the import process, VM Import will convert your VM into an Amazon EC2 AMI, which you can use to run Amazon EC2 instances.

     Import VMs to AWS: Move VMs from your existing virtualization platform (like VMware or Hyper-V) into EC2 instances. It essentially converts them into AMIs (Amazon Machine         Images) that you can readily use to launch new EC2 instances. This is useful when migrating workloads to the cloud without rebuilding servers from scratch.

    Export VMs from AWS: Take VMs running on EC2 instances and export them back to your on-premises virtualization environment in formats like VMDK, VHD/VHDX, or OVA. This             provides    flexibility in deploying workloads across your entire IT infrastructure.
