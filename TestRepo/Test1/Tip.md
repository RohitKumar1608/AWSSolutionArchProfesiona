1.   **AWS Snowball ** is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure appliances to transfer large amounts of data into and out of the AWS cloud. Using Snowball addresses common challenges with large-scale data transfers, including high network costs, long transfer times, and security concerns.

AWS Snowball moves terabytes of data in about a week. You can use it to move things like databases, backups, archives, healthcare records, analytics datasets, IoT sensor data,   and media content, especially when network conditions prevent realistic timelines for transferring large amounts of data both into and out of AWS. Data from the Snowball device will be imported to your selected Amazon S3 bucket.
